# Coding-Projects
Here is a brief overview of some of the more technical programming projects I undertook over the course of my Sophomore
and Junior Years.

Included in these files are the following:

Group Final Project for COMP 562: in which I implemented a classification model used to classify different breeds
of dogs based off of an images. I used Keras, an open sourced Python library, which provided me with pretrained neural network image
classifiers, as well as image preprocessing networks. A Jupyter Python notebook is included, and additionally, the final write-up in .pdf 
format is included.

Final Project for COMP 411: in which I implemented a postfix arithmetic interpreter in MIPS Assembly language. I implemented this using
a stack, and with the use of extended pseudo instructions.

Sample of Math and programming problems from MATH 661: A small overview of some of the homework problems I was assigned in MATH 661. These
problems include both programming problems, and proof based Math problems, writen in LaTex.
